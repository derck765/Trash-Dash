Hi!
I made this game with my friend for the national "Game For Change" competition in 2022 <br>
Our goal for this competition was to make a game to spread awareness about climate change <br>
We made a 2D platformer in which the player's goal is to collect trash to clean up the environment and proceed to the next level<br><br>
The original README file for the game can be found <a href = "https://github.com/derck765/Trash-Dash/blob/main/Assets/READ_ME.txt">here</a><br>
I have also uploaded the game online <a href="https://simmer.io/@derck_456/trash-dash">here</a> <br>
Thank you for your interest in my game
